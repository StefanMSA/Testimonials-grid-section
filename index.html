                  learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.

                <p>"I was an EMT fot many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                  I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for the
                   free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                   shortly thereafter.The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                    grueling - time of my life.Since completing the course,I've
                     successfully switched careers,working as a Software
                     Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <h4>Such a life-changing experience.Highly recommended!</h4>
            <p style="color:black">"Before joining the bootcamp, I;ve never written a line of code.
               I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                 student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                 program.The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.They
                  were very hands-on and  I never had to waiy long for
                  assistance.The agile team project,in particular,was
                  outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way
                  that no tutorial could ever have.In fact,I"ve often referred
                  to it during interviews as an example of my development
                  experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                  developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommend! "</p>
